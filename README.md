# Magic Library

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.library.svg?master)](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.library)

Helper project for [Magic](https://github.com/polterguy/magic), to wire up everything and initialize Magic.

This project will help you to wire up everything related to Magic.

## License

Although most of Magic's source code is publicly available, Magic is _not_ Open Source or Free Software.
You have to obtain a valid license key to install it in production, and I normally charge a fee for such a
key. You can [obtain a license key here](https://gaiasoul.com/license-magic/).
Notice, 5 hours after you put Magic into production, it will stop functioning, unless you have a valid
license for it.
